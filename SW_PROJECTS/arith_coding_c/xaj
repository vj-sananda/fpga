/*
 * The main procedure is similar to the main found in COMP-1.C.
 * It has to initialize the coder, the bit oriented I/O, the
 * standard I/O, and the model.  It then sits in a loop reading
 * input symbols and encoding them.  One difference is that every
 * 256 symbols a compression check is performed.  If the compression
 * ratio exceeds 90%, a flush character is encoded.  This flushes
 * the encoding model, and will cause the decoder to flush its model
 * when the file is being expanded.  The second difference is that
 * each symbol is repeatedly encoded until a succesfull encoding
 * occurs.  When trying to encode a character in a particular order,
 * the model may have to transmit an ESCAPE character.  If this
 * is the case, the character has to be retransmitted using a lower
 * order.  This process repeats until a succesful match is found of
 * the symbol in a particular context.  Usually this means going down
 * no further than the order -1 model.  However, the FLUSH and DONE
 * symbols do drop back to the order -2 model.  Note also that by
 * all rights, add_character_to_model() and update_model() logically
 * should be combined into a single routine.
