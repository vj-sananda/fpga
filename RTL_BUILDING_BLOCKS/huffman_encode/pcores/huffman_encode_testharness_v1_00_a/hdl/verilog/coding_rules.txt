Naming Conventions:
------------------
All signals have suffixes of the form:

 _[r,w].[c,d].{#} : choose 1 of the letters in each [] and
                      concatenate to build suffix

[r,w]: r=>register, w=>wire

[c,d]: c=>control,  d=>datapath

{#} : Optional. Reflects register stage number
      Eg: pop_rc1, is a cycle  delayed from pop_rc
          pop_rc2, is 2 cycles delayed from pop_rc 

RULES
-----
1. In the combinatorial block :
   1.1 Only *_w* signals must be on LHS. (get values assigned to them)
   1.2 All signals must have a default assignment, before the case
   1.3 Control signals that pulse must have a default assignment of 0
   1.4 Signals that hold their value, must have a default assignment to their registered equivalent.
       *_w* = *_r* ;
       Eg: push_pending_wc = push_pending_rc ;
   1.5 Conditional statements can use *_w* or *_r* signals.
   1.6 A conditional statement cannot use a signal in a its conditional expression and also have an assignment to it.
       Eg: if ( eom_detected_wc & fifo_full_rc )
	      eom_detected_wc = 0;
       (this will create a combinational loop).

2. In the clocked block:
   2.1 All Control signals must have a reset value., 
   2.2 All Datapath signals need not have a reset value, like those registers in the middle of a pipeline.
   2.3 Only *_r* signals must be on LHS.
   2.4 Signal assignments will be of the form *_r* <= *_w* ;

GUIDELINES
----------
1. In the combinatorial block :
   1.1 Generally datapath signals will "hold" values, whereas control signals will not.
   1.2 If a default assignment is missed, the synthesis tool will warn you about latches begin inferred.
